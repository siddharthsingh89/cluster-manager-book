## **Part II – Goals, API Contracts & High-Level Architecture**

If **Part I** laid the conceptual and historical groundwork for why cluster managers exist and how they evolved, **Part II** turns the focus toward *designing one*.
Here, we begin the transition from *theory* to *architecture*-from understanding distributed systems to shaping their form and boundaries.

A cluster manager, at its core, is a continuously running distributed control plane that must balance correctness, scalability, and operational simplicity. Designing one requires not just algorithms and data structures, but a clear articulation of goals, API boundaries, and the relationships among its major components.

This part captures that transition. It outlines how the system’s intent (its **product and operational goals**) gets distilled into **high-level architectural choices**, **APIs**, and **protocols** that shape everything downstream-from placement and rebalancing to recovery and observability.

### **Structure of This Part**

* **Chapter 9 – Product & Operational Goals**
  Establishes what the cluster manager must achieve: elasticity, reliability, availability, and developer experience. We translate business and product needs into measurable technical objectives.

* **Chapter 10 – High-Level Architecture Choices**
  Explores possible architectural blueprints-centralized vs. decentralized control, monolithic vs. modular services-and how trade-offs shape scalability, resilience, and maintainability.

* **Chapter 11 – APIs & Contracts**
  Defines the external and internal boundaries of the cluster manager: how clients, nodes, and operators interact through explicit contracts that ensure safety and evolution.

* **Chapter 12 – Membership & Discovery**
  Discusses how nodes find each other, join or leave the cluster, and maintain consistent views of the system in the face of churn and failure.

* **Chapter 13 – Placement & Replica Assignment**
  Details the logic that decides *where* data and tasks should live, balancing capacity, performance, and fault domains.

* **Chapter 14 – Rebalancing & Data Movement**
  Describes how the cluster adapts to growth, shrinkage, and topology changes without sacrificing availability or violating invariants.

* **Chapter 15 – Replication Coordination**
  Covers mechanisms that ensure replicas stay consistent, coordinated, and resilient-tying into the broader consistency and durability goals introduced earlier.

* **Chapter 16 – Recovery & Repair**
  Explains how the system restores health after node failures, data loss, or network partitions, emphasizing automation and minimal operator intervention.

* **Chapter 17 – Configuration Management**
  Focuses on how runtime parameters, policies, and feature flags are stored, versioned, and safely rolled out across distributed components.

* **Chapter 18 – Security & Multi-Tenant Isolation**
  Examines how authentication, authorization, and isolation boundaries are enforced in shared environments, ensuring tenant safety and compliance.

* **Chapter 19 – Observability & Tooling**
  Introduces the observability stack-metrics, logs, traces, and dashboards-that enable visibility, debugging, and continuous improvement.

* **Chapter 20 – Testing Strategy & Verification**
  Concludes the part with techniques to validate cluster correctness: simulation, fault injection, chaos testing, and continuous verification in production.

By the end of this part, readers will have a holistic blueprint of *what the cluster manager must do* and *how its core components communicate and evolve safely*.
It forms the conceptual bridge between **Part I (Foundations & Surveys)** and **Part III (Detailed Design & Implementation Patterns)**-moving from “*Why we need a cluster manager*” to “*How we begin to build one*.”
