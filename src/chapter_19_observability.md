# **Chapter 19 - Observability, Diagnostics & Tooling**

As systems evolve into distributed, multi-tenant environments, *observability* becomes indispensable. It’s no longer enough to know that the system is running; operators must understand *why* it behaves a certain way. Observability unifies metrics, logs, and traces to answer questions about performance, reliability, and user experience - while diagnostics and tooling provide the mechanisms to act on that insight.

---

## **19.1 The Role of Observability**

Observability is the degree to which the internal state of a system can be inferred from its external outputs.
It helps teams:

1. Detect failures early
2. Localize faults rapidly
3. Analyze performance regressions
4. Validate configuration or deployment changes
5. Improve system resilience through feedback loops

In distributed databases, observability is particularly complex because data paths span multiple nodes, tenants, and replication layers.

---

## **19.2 Core Pillars of Observability**

### **19.2.1 Metrics**

Metrics are numerical time-series data representing system health.

**Examples:**

* CPU usage, memory consumption
* Query latency (p50, p95, p99)
* Replica lag
* Disk I/O throughput
* Transaction retries or rollbacks

```rust
metrics::gauge("replica_lag_seconds", lag_value);
metrics::counter!("txn_commits_total", 1);
```

Metrics are the first indicators of degradation and can be scraped by systems like **Prometheus**, **OpenTelemetry Collector**, or **Vector**.

---

### **19.2.2 Logs**

Logs provide human-readable events useful for reconstructing state transitions.

**Types of logs:**

* **Access logs:** Client requests and responses
* **System logs:** Node startup, rebalancing, failure detection
* **Audit logs:** Security-sensitive events (see Chapter 18)

```rust
log::info!(
    "TxnCommit tenant={} txn_id={} duration_ms={}",
    tenant_id,
    txn_id,
    elapsed_ms
);
```

Logs are most useful when **structured** (JSON or key-value). This enables downstream analysis and filtering.

---

### **19.2.3 Traces**

Traces capture *causal relationships* between operations across components.
A single query may span multiple services: query planner → coordinator → storage node → replica.

Each span includes:

* **Trace ID:** Unique across the entire transaction
* **Span ID:** Unique per operation
* **Attributes:** Context (tenant_id, node_id, request_type)

Example (OpenTelemetry SDK):

```rust
let tracer = opentelemetry::global::tracer("query_service");
let span = tracer.start("PlanAndExecute");
span.set_attribute(KeyValue::new("tenant_id", tenant_id));
```

Visualization tools like **Jaeger** or **Tempo** can reconstruct distributed call graphs.

---

## **19.3 Distributed Diagnostics**

Diagnostics complement observability by enabling *targeted investigation and control*.

### **19.3.1 Health Probes**

Each node exposes health endpoints:

* `/health/liveness` → Node process running
* `/health/readiness` → Node ready for traffic
* `/health/replica` → Local replica consistency check

```rust
async fn readiness_check() -> bool {
    storage::is_mount_ok() && cluster::is_leaseholder_healthy()
}
```

These endpoints integrate with orchestrators (Kubernetes, Nomad, or internal cluster managers) to automate node recovery.

---

### **19.3.2 Debug Interfaces**

Each subsystem may expose internal state for inspection.

Example Debug API:

```
GET /debug/placement?tenant=1234
GET /debug/txn?txn_id=abc123
GET /debug/raft?group=42
```

Such APIs are read-only and should require elevated authentication to prevent misuse.

---

### **19.3.3 On-Demand Sampling**

To avoid overwhelming telemetry systems, sampling strategies are applied:

* **Head-based:** Randomly choose which requests to trace.
* **Tail-based:** Retain only slow or error traces.
* **Adaptive:** Increase trace rate during anomalies.

```rust
if latency_ms > 200 || rng.gen_bool(0.01) {
    trace_collector::record(span);
}
```

---

## **19.4 Observability Architecture**

A distributed observability pipeline typically includes:

```
[Node Agent] → [Collector] → [Storage] → [Dashboard / Alerts]
```

### **Components**

| Layer            | Responsibility                           |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Agent**        | Emits metrics/logs/traces from each node |
| **Collector**    | Aggregates and batches telemetry         |
| **Backend**      | Stores time-series and trace data        |
| **Dashboard**    | Visualizes KPIs and dependencies         |
| **Alert Engine** | Detects thresholds or anomalies          |

---

## **19.5 Tooling for Operators**

Tooling transforms raw observability into actionable control.

### **19.5.1 CLI Tools**

Operators use command-line tools to introspect or repair clusters.

Example commands:

```
dbctl cluster status
dbctl node drain --node=node-12
dbctl tenant quota --set=cpu=2 --tenant=5678
dbctl diag trace --txn=abc123
```

Each command wraps authenticated RPCs to the control plane, logging all invocations to the audit trail.

---

### **19.5.2 Admin Dashboard**

A browser-based dashboard provides:

* Cluster map (nodes, tenants, replicas)
* Resource utilization heatmaps
* Top N slow queries
* Alert feed with drill-downs

### **19.5.3 Trace Explorer**

Visualizes distributed query flow:

```
Client → Coordinator → Shard 3 → Replica 2 → Commit
```

Colored spans highlight latency bottlenecks.

---

## **19.6 Automated Anomaly Detection**

Machine learning can enhance observability by learning baseline patterns.

### **Approaches**

* **Seasonal Forecasting:** Detect deviation from normal daily usage.
* **Multivariate Analysis:** Correlate metrics (e.g., replica lag + CPU spikes).
* **Anomaly Scores:** Auto-generate alerts only when impact is significant.

Example pseudocode:

```rust
if anomaly_detector::score(metric_window) > 0.9 {
    alert::raise("Possible replication delay anomaly");
}
```

---

## **19.7 Incident Response and Root Cause Analysis**

When an incident occurs, observability data drives RCA (Root Cause Analysis).

### **Stages**

1. **Detection:** Alert triggers from thresholds or anomalies.
2. **Scoping:** Identify affected tenants or nodes.
3. **Traceback:** Examine causal chains from request traces.
4. **Verification:** Validate recovery and regression tests.
5. **Postmortem:** Record incident learnings.

**Tip:** Tag all changes (deployments, config edits) in observability metadata - it makes RCA far faster.

---

## **19.8 Observability Contracts**

### **API: ObservabilityContract**

```rust
trait ObservabilityContract {
    fn record_metric(name: &str, value: f64, labels: &[(&str, &str)]);
    fn emit_log(level: LogLevel, message: &str, context: &[(&str, &str)]);
    fn start_trace(span_name: &str) -> TraceHandle;
    fn push_trace(handle: TraceHandle);
}
```

This contract ensures uniform observability behavior across microservices.

---

## **19.9 Diagnostics Tooling Contract**

```rust
trait DiagnosticTooling {
    fn dump_state(component: &str) -> String;
    fn run_health_checks() -> Vec<HealthReport>;
    fn capture_trace(txn_id: &str) -> TraceReport;
}
```

Such interfaces empower both automated controllers and human operators to debug distributed state safely.

---

## **19.10 Challenges & Exercises**

**Challenges**

1. Design a unified telemetry schema that can represent metrics, logs, and traces consistently.
2. Implement tail-based sampling to capture only anomalous transactions.
3. Create a command-line diagnostic tool using gRPC to fetch live cluster state.

**Exercises**

* Build a Jaeger trace viewer for your query execution path.
* Write a health probe that verifies replica quorum availability.

---

## **Summary**

Observability converts raw system activity into insight. Diagnostics and tooling turn that insight into control. Together, they form the operational backbone of a reliable distributed database:

* **Metrics** quantify system health.
* **Logs** capture events and context.
* **Traces** reveal causal structure.
* **Tooling** closes the feedback loop with intelligent automation.
