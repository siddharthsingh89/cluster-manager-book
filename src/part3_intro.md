# Part III – Implementation

The architectural foundations are now complete. We have explored how nodes form clusters, how data is partitioned, replicated, and recovered, and how the control plane maintains consistency across distributed components.  
In this part, we translate those concepts into code.  

**Part III – Implementation** focuses on bringing the system to life-constructing the cluster core, implementing replication and consensus, wiring up metadata management, and building the operational surface through APIs and observability.  
Each chapter walks through a key subsystem, explaining the reasoning behind its design, showing interfaces and pseudocode, and highlighting trade-offs in real-world implementation.

### 4.1  Chapter 21 – Project Bootstrap  
We begin by setting up the repository, directory structure, build system, and module layout. This chapter establishes the coding conventions, dependency boundaries, and testing framework that will underpin the rest of the implementation.

### 4.2  Chapter 22 – Core Interfaces & Mocks  
Defines the foundational traits, data contracts, and mock layers used across the system. We isolate interfaces early to enable independent development, parallel testing, and clear abstraction boundaries.

### 4.3  Chapter 23 – Membership Service  
Implements cluster node registration, join/leave protocols, and gossip-based discovery. This forms the living heartbeat of the system, allowing nodes to dynamically form and maintain the cluster topology.

### 4.4  Chapter 24 – Failure Detector  
Builds a time-based heartbeat and suspicion mechanism for detecting crashed or unreachable nodes. The design emphasizes quick convergence without false positives.

### 4.5  Chapter 25 – Leader Election  
Implements consensus on leadership within partitions or replica groups. This chapter details election triggers, candidate states, and safe leadership transitions.

### 4.6  Chapter 26 – Metadata Manager  
Manages global cluster metadata-schemas, partitions, replicas, and placement rules. This chapter outlines persistence, versioning, and update propagation.

### 4.7  Chapter 27 – Placement Engine  
Responsible for mapping data to nodes. We discuss consistent hashing, rack awareness, and dynamic placement rules for balancing durability and locality.

### 4.8  Chapter 28 – Rebalancer & Migrator  
Covers automatic and manual data movement between nodes. Topics include shard migration, throttling, and background validation after movement.

### 4.9  Chapter 29 – Replication Coordinator  
Implements the write path-coordinating replicas, applying logs, and ensuring data consistency using Raft-style or quorum-based protocols.

### 4.10  Chapter 30 – Client-Facing Coordinator  
Handles incoming reads and writes, request routing, and linearizability guarantees. It forms the public interface to the distributed database.

### 4.11  Chapter 31 – Admin API & CLI  
Provides operational visibility and control. Includes cluster configuration commands, node inspection, and maintenance tooling.

### 4.12  Chapter 32 – Health & Metrics  
Implements runtime telemetry, node health probes, and metrics export for observability dashboards.

### 4.13  Chapter 33 – Testing & Chaos  
Explains the testing strategy-unit, integration, and fault-injection tests. It introduces chaos workflows for validating real-world resilience.

### 4.14  Chapter 34 – Deployment & Operations  
Describes how to package, deploy, and scale the system. Covers environment configuration, orchestration, and upgrade strategies.

### 4.15  Chapter 35 – Performance Tuning  
Focuses on profiling, optimizing I/O paths, memory management, and concurrency models for low-latency, high-throughput performance.

### 4.16  Chapter 36 – Hardening & Production Checklist  
Concludes the part with operational readiness: security tightening, disaster-recovery validation, and production best practices for a fault-tolerant distributed system.

By the end of this part, the reader will have a working end-to-end understanding of how each subsystem translates into real code-and how those pieces together form a resilient, scalable, and production-ready distributed database.
